[![Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/victor-ferrer/RxStokker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/victor-ferrer/RxStokker)

This is a personal learning project on Reactive Programming with Reactor and Spring.

The objetives are:
- Mimic the implementation of the tool [Stokker](https://github.com/victor-ferrer/stokker) but following a reactive approach.
- Act as a learning sandbox on other topics: Non-blocking I/O, etc.

Sometimes, I write about my learning progress in my Blog:
